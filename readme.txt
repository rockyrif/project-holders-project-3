Hi there, welcome to my interview exercise. I hope you are doing well.

I am Mohamed Rifky from Kalmunai. I am an HNDIT student at SLIATE Hardy ATI, currently in my final year. I am looking for an internship to complete the six-month training period required for my HNDIT program.

Let me talk about my work.

This is a pharmacy prescription management system. The concept of this project is that anyone can be a customer, and any shop can be a pharmacist by filling out simple forms. After that, they can complete their tasks.

Steps to Set Up the Project:
1. Add my database to your SQL database. (in my case I used XAMPP )
2. Place the project-holders-project-3 folder into c:/xampp/htdocs/
3. Configure the db_conn.php file with your database credentials
4. Go to http://localhost/project-holders-project-3/ in your browser
5. Select the option based on your position (customer or pharmacist)
6. If you are a customer, click "I am a customer" and then fill out the registration form.      Do the same for the pharmacist.
9. After registration, add a new prescription (the pharmacist will receive an email based on 10.the pharmacy name)
11.Log in to the account with pharmacist credentials
12.Then add a new quotation (the customer will receive an email notification)
13.The customer can then accept or reject the quotation.
